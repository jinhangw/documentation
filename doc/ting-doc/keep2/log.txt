First day, caught up with Lars and the progress of the project, learned about his andoid app and its functionalities
Learned about kml, which is file format for goole earth. learned about python scripting for google earth. 
Created python script for extracting EXIF data from all photos in a directory and saving them to a text file
Created python script for creating individual kml files for all photos in a directory using a data text file, and then 
creates a top level kml file that can be opened in Google Earth to display all the photos at their geographic locations.

6/5/2012 9:00 - 5:00 lunch: 12:00 - 1:00
modified python script for extracting data from EXIF data for flexibility with different types of output files, as well as adding additional data fields to be extracted, including resolution and rotation
modified python script for generating data file to create different formats to use with either ground overlay or photo overlay scripts
created python script that generates kml files for photo overlay images on google earth, using xml boject class
Added additional images to the library, and generated kml data from them using python script
Added the imaages to Google Earth
downloaded and installed Eclipse, Java SDK, Andrdroid SDK for installing android appls Lars develeoped

6/6/2012 9:00-5:00 lunch: 12:00 - 1:00
downloaded and installed Ubuntu 10.04 to Windows Virual PC and virtual box
modified and installed the andoid app that Lars developed, tested the app with sourroundings
tested different ways of tagging the photos with location data, including EXIF and external text file

6/7/2012 9:00 - 6:30, lunch: 12:30-2:00
decided on using external text file for recording location data
modified python script to used the generated text file for creating kml files
went outside to take pictures, went to the roads near newel simon hall, wean hall, and randy pauche bridge
took pictures around forbes ave, as well as below the bridge near craig st.
generated kml files for the pictures taken and modified their location, size, and orientation to fit on google earth
the process is still not completely automated, and requires human input

6/8/2012 9:00 - 12:00
modified python script, more user friendly output lines
modified additional captured images to fit on correct locations in google earth

6/11/2012 10:00 - 5:00, 19:00-22:00, lunch: 12:00 - 2:00
downloaded and installed ubuntu 10.04 on laptop, sttempted to set up ubuntu for work but some hardware driviers were missing
installed pyglet, pygame, and opencv to try to capture frames from a video.
the new app developed by lars now captures and saves a video, and its frames need to be extracted as individual images. the location data are stored in a separate text file

6/12/2012 9:30 - 5:30, 20:00-23:00 lunch: 12:30 - 1:30
ubuntu 10.04 could not be set up on my laptop, downloaded and installed 12.04 instead
set up ubuntu 10.04 for work, installed necessary programs and updates
installed openCV for python on Ubuntu
read about usage of openCV online, tried using openCV to extract frames from a video, encountered bugs
read online about ways to use openCV to load video, extract frames from it, and then save images
learned about converting video format with mencoder
finally succeeded in creating python script for extracting all frames from an avi file and saving the frames to a directory as png files

6/13/2012 9:00 -5:00, lunch 12:30 - 1:30, 22:00-23:00
tried to run the script on .mepg4 videos, found that the script always saves 4 extra empty frames
research about the bug, found that openCV has some issues working with videos in  Ubuntu linux
