To install any of the included apps simply attach the .apk file in an email and open in on your android device. The app should install itself. 

roadvid.apk starts capturing frames every 10th of a second and stores them as an .mp4 file in your mountable SD card directory under /Pictures/MyCameraApp/DATETIME/ where DATETIME refers to the date and time of the creation in the of the video. In the DATETIME directory you will also find a .txt file which a pair of longitude and latitude values recorded every 10th of a second seperated by newlines. The roadcam.apk file stores additional information about the pictures taken.
Note: if the app crashes make sure that your SD card has been properly mounted. This caused a lot of trouble for Ting.

roadcam.apk take an image every second and stores them in the same directory as roadvid.apk. An additional textfile is also created with relevant information however the data is stored in the following manner:
<filename>||<latitude>, <longitude>||<orientation around zenith>||<minimum focal distance>, <optimum focal distance>, <maximum focal distance>||<acceleration in X direction>, <acceleration in Y direction>, acceleration in Z direction> \n
Note X, Y, Z directions are displayed here: http://developer.android.com/images/axis_device.png
A new folder is created everytime a new sequence of photos is initiated with the "start" button. Hitting "stop" will cause a new folder with images to be created the next time the app is run.
