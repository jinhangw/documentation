The function rotateImg takes as input an image, the angle by which the image is to be rotated and the focal length of the camera and produces a rotated image.

The field of view  and the resolution of the output image is controlled by two parameters h1 and h2. 
h1 is the height from the top of the original image that is to be included in the projected image.
h2 is the height at which we wish to preserve the resolution of the input image.

Please refer to the figure rotateImg.png which shows how h1 and h2 are applied.
