order
to upload the data that was collected we have decided to use the
dropbox API. There are a few things that go into making this work on
Android, here I will explain them. We created an extra dropbox account
soley for the purpose of data collection. Since technically anyone
could use the app with their own dropbox account we made a centralized
one with the credentials: email - cmupothole@gmail.com</small></small><span

I registered the app under the name "cmupothole". This is the name of
the folder that gets created in the Dropbox account if someone is using
the app for the first time. However, this app currently only works with
this developer account and any other accounts that we previously
registered. If we want this app to become public we will first need to
get Dropbox's approval. <br>
I set the app up to upload everything in the folder under
/sdcard/Pictures/MyCameraApp/, and then promptly delete the files.<br>
On android, make sure that you have the app's key and secret, this can
be founder under <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps">www.dropbox.com/developers/apps</a>.
The
key and secret are used during authentication which is explained
here: </small></small></big></big><a

 href="https://www.dropbox.com/developers/start/authentication#android">d<span
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">. </span></a>However, don't forget to
include the following in your Manifest file: &lt;data
android:scheme="db-&lt;APPKEY&gt;" /&gt; replacing &lt;APPKEY&gt; with
your app key. (Also don't forget the &lt;uses-permission
android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" /&gt; line to get internet
access).&nbsp; Once the user has authenticated, try to save their keys
data using the SharedPreferences class. I do this in my
RoadcamActivity.getKeys() method.<br>
Once you upload a file make sure not to do this on the main thread,
otherwise android will complain and throw a networkonmainthread
exception. You can do this by creating a class which extends asyncTask,
placing the networking operations in a doInBackground(...) method and
calling the built in execute() method on the class. <br>
