    <h1><a name="mozTocId245475"></a>Additional features for app</h1>
    <p>We want to extend the functionality of the app. For one thing, we
      want to make it as self-contained and automatic as possible to
      install it on the users vehicle with no or minimal user input
      needed.
      Another thing is that we like to get additional information like
      speed, windshield wiper on/off, headlights on/off and other things
      that measure the vehicle state or indicate driving conditions.</p>
    <h2 class="western"><a name="mozTocId929002"></a>Vehicle ignition
      on/off</h2>
    <p>It is very important to know if the vehicle is being operated or
      not in order not to waste power and disk space. There are several
      options that might indicate if the vehicle is on or off:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The power to the cigarette
          lighter: In some cars, the power to the cigarette lighter is
          switched off when the ignition is switched off. One would need
          to detect if the device is being charged or not. There
          certainly are indicators that show if the device is being
          charged. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Vibrations: As soon as the engine
          is on there are vibrations of a few hertz. These might be
          detectable by the accelerometers. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Ignition on/off indication from
          the OBDII: From other projects we know that the OBDII
          indicates ignition on/off </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>GPS: If the vehicle is stationary, there will be no change in
          GPS. This probably unreliable, GPS is not always available and
          one could not distinguish between waiting at a red light and
          shutting off the engine. However, if the vehicles are always
          parked in the same area at the end of the day.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="western"><a name="mozTocId128841"></a>OBDII</h2>
    <p>From other projects we know that OBDII has a lot of information,
      e.g. ignition on/off and speed. We connected it to a data
      collection
      box via OBDII interface-&gt;serial port. There are serial-to-USB
      converters. But this seems to be a complicated way to do it. A
      more
      promising way might be to have a Wifi-OBDII or bluetooth-OBDII
      transeiver. Some are specifically made for smartphones (but
      several
      are only for iPhone, iPad)</p>

    <h2 class="western"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId637344"></a>Sensor
      fusion</h2>
    <br>
    Sensor fusion
    tutorial, contains free software:<br>
    <br>
    <a
href="http://www.thousand-thoughts.com/2012/03/android-sensor-fusion-tutorial/">http://www.thousand-thoughts.com/2012/03/android-sensor-fusion-tutorial/</a><br>
    <br>
    In Android 4.0 the
    sensor fusion might already be done, see
    <a
href="http://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-4.0.html#Sensors">http://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-4.0.html#Sensors</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    Additionally, Androidâ€™s three
    synthetic sensors have been greatly improved so they now have lower
    latency and smoother output. These sensors include the gravity
    sensor
    (<code class="western"><a
href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Sensor.html#TYPE_GRAVITY">TYPE_GRAVITY</a></code>),
rotation
    vector sensor (<code class="western"><a
href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Sensor.html#TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR">TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR</a></code>),
and
    linear acceleration sensor (<code class="western"><a
href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Sensor.html#TYPE_LINEAR_ACCELERATION">TYPE_LINEAR_ACCELERATION</a></code>).
The
    improved sensors rely on the gyroscope sensor to improve their
    output, so the sensors appear only on devices that have a gyroscope.<br>
    <br>
    Apparently there are several virtual
    sensors:<br>
    <br>
    Gravity sensor<br>
    <br>
    Linear acceleration sensor Gravity and motion acceleration deduced
    from accelerometer and the
    gyroscope<br>
    <br>
    Orientation sensor roll/pitch/yaw from the compass<br>
    <br>
    corrected gyroscope sensor drift compensated gyroscope<br>
