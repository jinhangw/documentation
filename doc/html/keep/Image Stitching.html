    <h1>Image Stitching</h1>
    <p><b><big>Overview<br>
          <br>
        </big></b>The images of the surface of the road can be in two
      forms: <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      individual photos taken by the RoadCam app or similar camera apps;
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      individual frames from video recorded by the RoadVid app, or
      similar recording app.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Regardless of the method used, the challenge is to create a
      uniform, high-resolution image of the entire length of the roads
      that can be seamlessly incorporated into the lower resolution
      satellite images from Google Earth. To achieve this, many
      approaches were experimented with.<br>

    <p><b>SIFT</b><br>
      Stands for Scale-Invariant Feature Transform, SIFT is an algorithm
      developed by David Lowe for detecting features within images. One
      key characteristic of the algorithm is that the feature
      recognition is not dependent on the scale of the image being
      processed, which also extends to both resolution and orientation.
      This makes SIFT an important algorithm in many image stitching
      software.<br>

    <p><b>opencv_stitching<br>
      </b></p>
    <p>This is an application within the opencv library that allows for
      the creation of a panoramic image through combining and stitching
      together multiple images. To run it, use the command
      opencv_stitching -&lt;input file&gt;. One common flag used is
      --warp, which changes the warp surface type and defaults to
      spherical. Since the focus here is to create a combined bird's eye
      view of the road instead of a panoramic image, setting the flag
      plane produces more desirable results.<br>
    </p>
    <p>opencv_stitching has a very simple interface, directly from the
      terminal. There are a lot of parameters that can be changed,
      though using only the default will still produce desirable output.
      Since this application is still in beta development, there are
      various bugs that exist. For example, <font color="#ff0000">opencv_stitch
        will cause segmentation fault randomly</font> during execution,
      and <font color="#ff0000">have memory allocation errors <font
          color="#000000">when stitching a large number of files.</font></font>
      However, since it is open-source and is run from the terminal, it
      is very easy to <font color="#33cc00">incorporate into other
        scripts<font color="#000000"> to create an automated process.<br>
        </font></font></p>
    <p>Platform: Linux/Windows<br>
      Installation: Does not need separate install, to install opencv,

    <p><b>Hugin</b></p>
    <p>This is a cross-platform panoramic imaging tool, though only the
      Windows version is tested. It offers a lot of functionality and is
      highly customizable. There are a lot of settings and options
      throughout the stitching process, which require a lot of user
      input. However, it seems that Hugin is <font color="#ff0000">not
        very successful at recognizing features from bird's-eye view of
        road surfaces<font color="#000000"> and has a difficult time
          piecing together multiple images.</font></font><br>
    </p>
    <p>Platform: Linux(not tested)/OS X(not tested)/Windows<br>
      Interface: Highly customizable, a lot of user input reqired<br>

    <p><b>Autostitch</b></p>
    <p>This is a program developed by University of Bath. It's interface
      is very simple and offers a very limited degree of customization.
      Tests using road surface images did not produce desirable result.
      The <font color="#ff0000">stitched image was very distorted and
        only small parts were stitched together</font>. However, this is
      only the demo version, and <font color="#009900">c</font><font
        color="#33cc00">ommercial versions are availabl</font>e for
      purchase, which may offer greater functionality.<br>

    <p><b>Windows Live Photo Gallery<br>
      </b></p>
    <p>This is an image editing software offered by Microsoft as part of
      the Windows Live Essentials bundle. It is designed specifically
      for windows and as such it's interface is very easy to use and
      offers a lot of customization options. The stitching functionality
      is provided by&nbsp; "Create--&gt;panorama" which is an entirely
      automated process that stitches selected images together. This is
      the most productive of the several algorithms tested, <font
        color="#33cc00">as it </font><font color="#33cc00">was able to
        stitch most of the images most of the time</font>. However, <font
        color="#ff0000">significant warping exists</font> with the
      produced images and will require further touch up. It also offers
      another functionality, called "straighten", which either
      automatically or allows the user to manually rotate and crop the
      image to the correct orientation. When stitching the <font
        color="#33cc00">straightened images the resultant image is less
        warped and has less distortion. <font color="#000000">However,
          one problem that exists is that there is no easy way to
          incorporate the live photo gallery into any kind of script
          since Microsoft only offers SDK for creating plugins.
          Therefore it <font color="#ff0000">may be very hard to
            automate the process</font>.</font><br>
