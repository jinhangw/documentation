  <title>Best Update Rate and Resolution</title>

<h1>Best update rate and resolution</h1>
The tradeoffs to higher update rate and resolution are increased
storage, data transfer and computation. So far (beginning of 2013) our
system has been taxing on these three but they have not yet reach a
point where they become roadblocks. We therefore want to find the point
where an increase in update rate and/or resolution will only give
marginal improvements to the data quality.<br>
<br>
<h2>Resolution</h2>
Because we are taking data from a moving platform, the images we are
taking have motion blurr. There will be little improvements in the data
quality if the pixel resolution is smaller than the motion blurr.
Therefore we will calculate the point where the pixel resolution is the
same as the motion blurr.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
At a typical urban speed of 35 mph (15.6 m/s) and the fastest shutter
speed of the camera (1/2000 s, Galaxy Camera) the motion blurr is 7.8
mm in the driving direction. We consider the scene at a distance of 5m
from the camera and the camera is at a height of 1.2m. The 7.8 mm is
projected onto the vertical and becomes the size of 7.8mm*1.2m/5m = 1.9
mm. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Result: Vertical motion blurr is
about 2 mm at 5 m distance. <br>
<br>
The horizontal and vertical resolutions are the same. Horizontally we
want to cover about one lane (3 m) at a distance of 5m. If each pixel
covers 2 mm, we would need 1500 pixels. The horizontal resolution of
1080p video is about 2000, i.e. the resolution of 1080p video is
sufficient<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Result: If the camera is mounted at
1.2 m and set up to take 1080p video that covers one lane (3 m) at a
distance of 5 m, then the pixel resolution is about the same as the
motion blurr resulting from a speed of 35 mph.</span><br>
<br>
<h2>Update rate</h2>
To get sufficient overlap between consecutive images we want the
vehicle to move only about 1 m between frames. At 35 mph (15.6 m/s) and
a 10 Hz update rate the movement between frames is 1.56 m.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Compression</h2>
We compared the compression rate between video (standard HD from
camera) with JPG. The compression is about the same, i.e. the size of a
video (48 Mb) is only a bit less than the size of the individual frames
saved as JPG files (about 55 Mb, but varies considerably: 50Mb - 100
Mb). Therefore file size is not an improtant point to consider if
deciding between saving the data as HD vidoe or as JPG files.<br>
