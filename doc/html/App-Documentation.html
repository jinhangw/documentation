<br>
To install any of the included apps simply attach the .apk file in an
email and open in on your android device. The app should install
itself. <br>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId834016"></a>roadcam</h2>
<br>
roadcam.apk take an image every second and stores them in the same
directory as roadvid.apk. An additional textfile is also created with
relevant information however the data is stored in the following manner:<br>
&lt;filename&gt;||&lt;latitude&gt;, &lt;longitude&gt;||&lt;orientation
around zenith&gt;||&lt;minimum focal distance&gt;, &lt;optimum focal
distance&gt;, &lt;maximum focal distance&gt;||&lt;acceleration in X
direction&gt;, &lt;acceleration in Y direction&gt;, acceleration in Z
direction&gt; \n<br>
Note X, Y, Z directions are displayed here:

A new folder is created everytime a new sequence of photos is initiated
with the "start" button. Hitting "stop" will cause a new folder with
images to be created the next time the app is run.<br>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId914312"></a>roadvid</h2>
<br>
roadvid.apk starts capturing frames every 10th of a second and stores
them as an .mp4 file in your mountable SD card directory under
/Pictures/MyCameraApp/DATETIME/ where DATETIME refers to the date and
time of the creation in the of the video. In the DATETIME directory you
will also find a .txt file which a pair of longitude and latitude
values recorded every 10th of a second seperated by newlines. The
roadcam.apk file stores additional information about the pictures taken.<br>
Note: if the app crashes make sure that your SD card has been properly
mounted. This caused a lot of trouble for Ting.<br>
