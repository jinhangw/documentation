<h1><a class="mozTocH1" name="mozTocId386191"></a>Putting Images
together</h1>
There are several methods to put images together. Image stitiching is
where two images are stitched together to form one new image. An
example is forming a panoramic image from several images which were
taken from the same location. Structure-from-motion reconstructs the
positions of the camera(s) and the 3D structure of the scene given
images taken from different locations.With a Ceres solver one can
improve the path given by GPS measurements by comparing them to a given
map. This will enable one to accurately put images in a map given GPS
tags.<br>

<br>
<p><b><big>Overview<br>
<br>
</big></b>The images of the surface of the road can be in two forms: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; individual
photos taken by the RoadCam app or similar camera apps; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; individual
frames from video recorded by the RoadVid app, or similar recording app.<br>
</p>
<p>Regardless of the method used, the challenge is to create a uniform,
high-resolution image of the entire length of the roads that can be
seamlessly incorporated into the lower resolution satellite images from
Google Earth. To achieve this, many approaches were experimented with.<br>

<p><b>SIFT</b><br>
Stands for Scale-Invariant Feature Transform, SIFT is an algorithm
developed by David Lowe for detecting features within images. One key
characteristic of the algorithm is that the feature recognition is not
dependent on the scale of the image being processed, which also extends
to both resolution and orientation. This makes SIFT an important
algorithm in many image stitching software.<br>

<p><b>opencv_stitching<br>
</b></p>
<p>This is an application within the opencv library that allows for the
creation of a panoramic image through combining and stitching together
multiple images. To run it, use the command opencv_stitching -&lt;input
file&gt;. One common flag used is --warp, which changes the warp
surface type and defaults to spherical. Since the focus here is to
create a combined bird's eye view of the road instead of a panoramic
image, setting the flag plane produces more desirable results.<br>
</p>
<p>opencv_stitching has a very simple interface, directly from the
terminal. There are a lot of parameters that can be changed, though
using only the default will still produce desirable output. Since this
application is still in beta development, there are various bugs that
exist. For example, <font color="#ff0000">opencv_stitch will cause
segmentation fault randomly</font> during execution, and <font
 color="#ff0000">have memory allocation errors <font color="#000000">when
stitching a large number of files.</font></font> However, since it is
open-source and is run from the terminal, it is very easy to <font
 color="#33cc00">incorporate into other scripts<font color="#000000">
to create an automated process.<br>
</font></font></p>
<p>Platform: Linux/Windows<br>

<p><b>Hugin</b></p>
<p>This is a cross-platform panoramic imaging tool, though only the
Windows version is tested. It offers a lot of functionality and is
highly customizable. There are a lot of settings and options throughout
the stitching process, which require a lot of user input. However, it
seems that Hugin is <font color="#ff0000">not very successful at
recognizing features from bird's-eye view of road surfaces<font
 color="#000000"> and has a difficult time piecing together multiple
images.</font></font><br>

<p><b>Autostitch</b></p>
<p>This is a program developed by University of Bath. It's interface is
very simple and offers a very limited degree of customization. Tests
using road surface images did not produce desirable result. The <font
 color="#ff0000">stitched image was very distorted and only small parts
were stitched together</font>. However, this is only the demo version,
and <font color="#009900">c</font><font color="#33cc00">ommercial
versions are availabl</font>e for purchase, which may offer greater
functionality.<br>

<p><b>Windows Live Photo Gallery<br>
</b></p>
<p>This is an image editing software offered by Microsoft as part of
the Windows Live Essentials bundle. It is designed specifically for
windows and as such it's interface is very easy to use and offers a lot
of customization options. The stitching functionality is provided
by&nbsp; "Create--&gt;panorama" which is an entirely automated process
that stitches selected images together. This is the most productive of
the several algorithms tested, <font color="#33cc00">as it </font><font
 color="#33cc00">was able to stitch most of the images most of the time</font>.
However, <font color="#ff0000">significant warping exists</font> with
the produced images and will require further touch up. It also offers
another functionality, called "straighten", which either automatically
or allows the user to manually rotate and crop the image to the correct
orientation. When stitching the <font color="#33cc00">straightened
images the resultant image is less warped and has less distortion. <font
 color="#000000">However, one problem that exists is that there is no
easy way to incorporate the live photo gallery into any kind of script
since Microsoft only offers SDK for creating plugins. Therefore it <font
 color="#ff0000">may be very hard to automate the process</font>.</font><br>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId160426"></a>Image stabilisation</h2>
Image stabilisation is similar to image stitching as it tries to find
the motion from one image to another. However, it makes two fundamental
assumptions:<br>
<ol>
  <li>The images are ordered</li>
  <li>The motion from one image to the next is small</li>
</ol>

This package makes use of Bundler - an open source bundle adjustment
tool, which constructs a sparse 3D point cloud from a set of input
images. It also uses the <a
 href="http://grail.cs.washington.edu/software/cmvs/">CMVS/PMVS</a>
packages that take the output of Bundler and create a dense 3D
reconstruction. This gives reasonably good results on images taken on
the street, except that it doesn't do a really job of fitting the road
surface texture on the 3D reconstruction. However, Bundler gives the
camera positions for each image; this can be handy if we are trying to
create a 2D birds-eye mosaic of the road surface.<br>
