We tried to set up an FTP server on the old windows machine that we had in the lab by installing ubuntu server 7.04. However, we are completely unable to register the machine in this manner so we will instead install ubuntu 10.04 to try again. I was able to get an FTP server running on my local machine however I realized that we will need a static IP address to consistantly FTP into whatever machine we wind up using for this experiment. 

The roadvid app also does not work for phones with API lower than 11 (android 3.0). The reason for this is that anything below API level 11 does not support the ability to change the video cameras frame rate. If we recorded video at the full 30 fps it would be approximatly 3 megabytes for a minute of footage according to Ting on his phone. Here it becomes evident that there is no easy way of recording and transfering all of this data. Christoph mentioned using dropbox on our
phones this morning however unfortunately this is not feasable since we do not have any control over what the Dropbox app actually uploads or downloads.
