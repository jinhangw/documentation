from an android device to our server.</span></h1>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></span>Google
docs:
<span style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);">Feasible, (see Dropbox)</span><br>
Every account gets 5gb of free space, and there is a 10gb limit on
uploads<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>.
</span>However uploading from android and retrieving the files on our
server can be a little tricky to set up initially. If we get the system
running it should be much easier to set up for anyone using these tools.<br>
(This looks like the best option)<br>
We tried this approach however google handles user authentication on
its own. Any app written that uses google docs requires for the user
the log themselves in. This prevents us from hardcoding any credentials
into our app which we need to do in order to access the files that the
app uploads. <br>
<br>
Google app-engine: <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">NOT FEASIBLE</span><br>
I can't find a hard limit on the total volume of files uploaded,
however each file must be less than 32mb. This can be worked around by
uploading in 32mb chunks. However, setting up the server and uploading
and downloading is much easier for us to set up on our end. We would
use the blobstore API and <a
 href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/blobstore/">https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/blobstore/</a>
details how to set it up. Android also has a built in HTTP library
which would make set up fairly simple on the app end.<br>
(This should be a backup plan)<br>
We tried this approach however it never worked on the server side. The
website was setup using the instructions found at the above link
however when visiting http://www.appspot.cmuroadupload.com/ we get a
"SERVER ERROR: 500" message. So far this problem has been unresolved.<br>
<br>
FTP: <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">NOT FEASIBLE</span><br>
Here we would have no upload or download restrictions since we would be
hosting our own server. However for it to run whoever is setting this
up would need to do so on a static IP and forward the necessary ports.
They would also have to do some setup on the app end of the system.
This is why we are avoiding this method. <br>
<br>
Dropbox: <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></span><span
 style="color: rgb(51, 204, 0);">In use</span><br>
This would be very easy for anyone to run on any sort of machine.
However, on the android end of the application the user would manually
have to specify which files they want to upload to the server which
could become tedious or difficult for the average user. This is because
the phone does not look for or store any files automatically (aside for
photos taken with androids main camera app).<br>
We found documentation for the Dropbox API that works on android. This
approach seemed feasible until we realized that it has the same problem
as the google docs API; they both handle user authentication on their
end preventing us from ever accessing the files that a user would
upload. <br>
<br>
We are using Dropbox (and could use google docs for the same reason)
with an external dropbox account. This allows anyone to use the app,
since anyone with a dropbox account can authenticate, however we will
only be interested in the data that we place on our account
(cmupothole@gmail.com). The app works by creating a folder in the users
dropbox account titled cmupothole/, where all the files are uploaded to
after hitting "upload".&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Email: <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">NOT FEASIBLE<br>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Here we run into file size limits
that would be too harsh on our system. Even though we can chunk the
files into smaller portions per email, we would still be limited to
whatever overall restrictions the email service has on total bandwidth.<br>
<br>
TCP: <br>
I plan to use TCP to send the data. We would open and bind port 80 and
use the python script located at ../lars/echo_server.py. This has
worked locally so far however we still need to see if it works on the
server that we set up in the lab. <br>
<br>
SkyDrive:<br>
(from Microsoft) gives you more storage than others (Google and
dropbox), but it does not work with Android.<br>
