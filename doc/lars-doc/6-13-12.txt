We also have the CVS repository running now. I have placed a copy of the roadvid and roadcam packages compiled and ready to launch with a README in the /doc/android-apps/ folder. However, when I followed the instructions that I wrote to run the app it launched without problems, however Ting was unable to get the app running by simply sending it to his phone as I did. Ting is now trying to install eclipse on his new ubuntu 12.04 installation to get it running. Perhaps
API version that we are using is a little to low to get the app to run on his phone, or maybe there are other problems since this crash is on launch and we can't get the stack trace without logcat running (in eclipse).

We also have openCV installed in order to retrieve individual frames from the video files that roadvid records. The videos are in .mp4 format and openCV can handel this well. However, Ting noticed every video has 4 excess empty frames at the end of it consistantly, and this occurs with every .mp4 video, not just the recorded ones. Hopefully this is standard and not a loss of information.  Tomorrow we will test that to find out.
