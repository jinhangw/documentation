We got the wired internet connection working on the old computer in order to set up the FTP server. However we realized that we will need to forward some ports manually using CMU's router for this to work outside of our LAN, therefore we are going to use HTTP to send the data instead. We will use google app engine to host a small server with upload capacity using googles blobstore API. Hopefully this will work better.
