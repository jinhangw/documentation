Ting and I went outside and collected image data behind Newell Simon and off of the Randy Pausch bridge using both of our phones. Ting then modified his script to work with our new data collection format (saving all data external to the images rather than modifying EXIF tags). However we are still seeing that some of the GPS data is repetitive indicating further that we cannot only rely on the GPS. However, the GPS data that we did collect became much more accurate after I let the GPS
and network location providers run constantly during the apps execution. This improvement was met with increased battery costs however the rest of the apps preformance was not infringed. I also set the autoFocusCallback to start the execution of the automatic image taking rather to prevent the camera from being overloaded with tasks and crashing as it had been before.
