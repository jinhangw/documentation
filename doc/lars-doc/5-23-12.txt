I finally have a working preview that doesn't crash on rotation. The fix I used was to ensure that the camera constantly stayed in portait mode, which was achieved by adding this to the manifest under activity:
android:screenOrientation="portrait"

Use parameters.setPictureSize(height, width) to set the final image resolution. 

We need to define which parameters to overwrite since there is no generic metadata tag that is accessable through the android SDK.
