I have successfully loaded a image onto google earth, the KML file is labeled test01.kml in the kml directory. I had to host the image on imgur.com and manually enter the bounding coordinate since I have no way of determining the height from which an image was taken. I could assume that they will be of constant height but even still the rotation of an image is unknown. I will write a script that automatically generates a KML file for an image that was taken as well with
latitued and longitude given as well as height.

I am using jhead (http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/jhead/) to extract coordinate data.

Mapquest API is not has useful as the google maps API for the same reason as Nokia maps, it is too specific to building apps taylored towards location services. 

Nice geotagging app to follow https://github.com/fedepaol/geotagger, we would need to implement saving:
GPSLatitude
GPSLongitude
GPSImgDirection
SubjectDistance (this can be retrieved using FocalDistance) 

Look into using kivy to develop the app, it would allow me to code in python rather than Java. 

opencv_stitching for placing images togethere. 
    We could either stitch onto an existing set of images with GPS coordinates known (google maps data)
    Or, stitch together a set of photos preserving the GPS coordinates for each.
