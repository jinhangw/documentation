I took many pictures of Morewood Avenue just north of Forbes Avenue where there seemed to be many potholes since the roads will be paved tomorrow. Upon taking the pictures I realized that the way I was listening for GPS/Location updates was not accurate enough. So tomorrow I will reimplement the location services by keeping the GPS listener on for the duration of the camera app runtime rather than only have it on when taking a picture. Hopefully this will yeild better results.
