I have loaded the example photocapturing app onto my phone, after modifying my /etc/udev/rules.d/android.rules file to include SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="04e8", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"

(This is specific to the Samsung line of phones as denoted by the idVendor setting of 04e8)

When taking picture from android devices it turns out that it is important to actually display the camera output onto the screen, (this is a security feature to prevent malicous apps from taking images without a user knowing). So a camera.Preview class must be written first.
