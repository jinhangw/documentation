Today we succesfully completed and created the new roadvid app which takes pictures at every 10th of a second or so. The only problem with this new approach is that it is hard to perfectly sync up the GPS location data with each individual frame. The reason for this is that the camera will start running whenever it is ready, however we do not know when this is exactly and therefore cannot perfectly sync up the collection of location data. Luckily the start of the camera
is fairly instantaneous and there should be little delay between the frames we record and the actual data we get.
