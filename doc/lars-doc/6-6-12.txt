We are currently working on getting the mobile app "roadstresscam" to work on Tings phone as well. Without sacrificing functionality I was able to port the app to android 2.3.3 (API 10). All that we need now is for Ting to finish installing the android software on his computer so he can install the app himself. We got the app working on his Atrix 4g android phone after mounting his SD card. No modification to the code was necessary only changes on the phone needed to be
made. We now also save data about every image with the following format:writeImageData(fileName.substring(fileName.lastIndexOf("/")+1) + "||" + longitude + ", " + latitude + "||" + orientation + "||" + results[0] + ", " + results[1] + ", " + results[2] + "||" + accelx[0] + ", " + accely[0] + ", " + accelz[0] + "\n");
    	(results[0] -> [2] refers to the 3 possible focal lengths that the camera could have used).
