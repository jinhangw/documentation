2 new interns came in today. So far only Ting (ECE major) is staying here to work. Christoph has asked me to have him try to write a script to automatically place the images that we have taken onto google maps using KML. I have shown him how to use the KML files and he has written the script.
We are also looking into PhotoOverlays to place images at an angle onto the ground. We are currently using GroundOverlays which simply pastes the image flat onto the specified area. 
We also now have a working script to place the KML files onto a map at any point, however we are unsure if we want to keep writing all of the necessary data into the EXIF data since this is proving to become a little cumbersome and messy.
