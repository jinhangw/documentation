Came in a little late today, started working on android application to take images and tag them with relevant EXIF data. By modifying source availabe at: http://labs.makemachine.net/2010/03/simple-android-photo-capture/ I have been able to implement a working camera app that captures single frames and stores them on the android device. The folowing link: http://android-er.blogspot.com/2011/04/update-gps-tag-using.html details how I would tag these images with any relevant data that I
might need. The only problem that I still have to resolve is how to take these pictures at a given timestep. Currently I am launching the camera app and then waiting for a user response to take an image, however from here I do not know how I can automatically snap the picture just yet...
