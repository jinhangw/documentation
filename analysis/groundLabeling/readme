Ground labeling software:
Download Derek Hoiem's image pop software from this link:
http://www.cs.illinois.edu/homes/dhoiem/projects/context/GeometricContext.zip
Extract this package and put it into directory say, imagePop.

Also this package need an external package, which you need to download seperately:
people.cs.uchicago.edu/~pff/segment/
Extract it into imagePop directory too.

Open imagePop/GeometricContext/src/im2superpixels.m
Change the following line:
segcmd = 'segment 0.8 100 100';
into:
segcmd = 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib64 ../../segment/segment 0.8 100 100';

Open matlab
cd imagePop/GeometricContext/src/;
addpath(genpath('.'));
photoPopupIjcv('../data/ijcvClassifier.mat', inputImageFileName, [], '../test_dir/')



Shadow detection package:
Download the package from this link:
http://www.jflalonde.org/software/shadowDetection.zip
It depends on a external package, which it didn't mention at all in its README.
The only clue is a few function call names.
It turns out to be this graph cut paclage:
http://vision.ucla.edu/~brian/gcmex-2.3.0.zip
I am using version 1.9 though.
You need to compile it in Matlab though with mex command.

add a line at the beginning of demoShadowDetection.m function:
addpath('../GCmex1.9');
then:
demoShadowDetection(dirName, imgName)
I think modified the interface a little bit to be batch-run-friendly, but it should not be too different.
You could all add a bit code in demoShadowDetection to save the result.



Lane detection package:
cd src
make release

You need to modify CameraInfo.conf and input your camera's intrinsics and camera position to get any meaningful result.
(I still didn't get meaningful result even though I did this. Not sure why yet.)

Example command:
./LaneDetector64 --show-lane-numbers --save-images --list-file='imgfilename.txt' --list-path='../../20120802_163433/'

imgfilename.txt is a file of filenames to be processed, one filename per line.
